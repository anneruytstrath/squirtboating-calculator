Hello! 

This is the Squirtboating Calculator, a handy web page for Freestyle Kayakers like myself who like to sink...
It aims to help athletes and coaches who are contemplating/planning their comp rides, as well as judges to help with scoring.
It contains all of the ICF tricks, with scores according to the updated 2025 ICF appendices. 
Make sure that if you include a trick with a bonus, you tick both boxes (of the trick in the desired direction, and the box with the clean/super clean/heli bonus). 
It will tally up the score below, and you get an overview of the ride to see what was performed.

NB: Yes, I am aware that the 'heli' bonus does not count for non-vertical tricks, but for unofficial meets this does sometimes score, so it was kept in.

I hope this is useful for anyone out there. 

Charge the Barge and Stay Sendy,

Anne Ruyters
